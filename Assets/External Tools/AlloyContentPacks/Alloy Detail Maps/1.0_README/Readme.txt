Greetings!

Thanks for purchasing the Alloy 3 Detail Map Mega pack!

Included in this pack you will find a number of categories of detail map sets
comprised of normal map, occlusion (most of the time), and color (for a few).

For each set, an included pre-packed _AlloyDM file is included for use with Alloy
shaders. Please remember that when using Alloy detail mapping, you MUST put a 
packed detail map in this slot, even if its the blank default one. If you don't
do this, your model will appear as 100% rough.

Two things to note in terms of how to get the most out of these maps:

1. You rarely will want/need the detail intensity slider at 1.0 when using these.
Their intensity-as-authored is such to get the most detail into the fixed range
of a texture, but you frequently should turn these down to .2-.4 to get a more
realistic look, especially with a low repeat #.

2. Just because I've placed these in a given category doesn't mean they're not
useful on other types of objects. Always feel free to play around with a wide
range of detail normals on your objects. You'd be surprised how many objects
a 'rocky' detail map actually looks great on.

3. If you have any usage questions, hit me up on twitter at @AntonHand

Have fun!
